My name is Racheal Ologun, and I’m a recent graduate of the University of Lagos with a degree in Chemistry Education. While my academic journey began in science and teaching, I discovered a strong passion for data analysis — driven by my love for investigation and working with numbers.

After graduation, I transitioned into data analysis through two intensive bootcamps, where I gained hands-on experience with SQL, Excel, Power BI, and Python. In my first bootcamp, I worked on a customer sales analysis project, using data to draw insights and create impactful visualizations.

During my second bootcamp, I participated in a hackathon where my team developed an app to help Africans connect with job market opportunities. I served as the Assistant Team Lead Data Analyst, helping shape our data approach and deliver valuable insights.

I’ve documented all my projects and progress on my GitHub portfolio, showcasing my growth, technical skills, and problem-solving mindset.

I am currently seeking an entry-level role or internship in data analysis where I can apply my skills, continue learning, and contribute to meaningful projects. I’m eager to join a collaborative team and help turn data into actionable insights that drive real-world results.
